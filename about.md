Hi! I'm Ryan, and this is my research portfolio.

I'm a student at Millburn High School currently studying artificial intelligence and its various applications. For the past few years, I've worked on projects ranging from [facial recognition security systems](https://orangese.github.io//2020/11/1/aisecurity) to [AI-based drug design for COVID-19](https://orangese.github.io//2021/06/21/vbind/).

My current research involves reformulating ideas from natural language processing to better understand protein dynamics, particularly in the context of physics-free *de-novo* drug design.

For more information, please visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-park-mhs/) or view my [resume](public/resume.pdf). You can reach me at [ryanpark314@gmail.com](mailto:ryanpark314@gmail.com).
