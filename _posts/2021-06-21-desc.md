title: Language Models, Manifold Learning, and COVID-19

This research presents a novel machine-learning approach, called V-BIND, for the identification of potential treatments against SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen of COVID-19. With V-BIND, 30 potential protein drugs were designed–of which 27 bind effectively to the virus.

### Introduction

Despite the existence of effective vaccines, there is no widely accepted COVID-19 drug therapy. The proposed algorithm designs drug therapies in the form of artificial miniproteins that bind to the viral spike protein, thereby disabling SARS-CoV-2’s attack method and preventing infection.

### Motivation

V-BIND is inspired by recent research into natural language processing

### Discussion
Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Lanyon here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Lanyon features

In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:

* Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) via **☰** link in top corner
* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes), available via `<body>` classes

### Browser support

Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
