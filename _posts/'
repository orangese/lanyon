title: V-BIND: Deep Geometric Transformers for SARS-CoV-2 Treatment Design
---

This research presents a novel machine-learning approach, called V-BIND, for the identification of potential treatments against SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen of COVID-19. With V-BIND, 30 potential protein drugs were designed–of which 27 bind effectively to the virus.

### Introduction

Despite the existence of effective vaccines, there is no widely accepted COVID-19 drug therapy. The proposed algorithm designs drug therapies in the form of artificial miniproteins that bind to the viral spike protein, thereby disabling SARS-CoV-2’s attack method and preventing infection.
