title: X-Net‚ÄìA Deep Convolutional Neural Model for X-Ray Threat Detection
---

This research proposes X-Net, a novel deep learning architecture that enhances airport security through the detection of threats in X-ray luggage scans. X-Net detects luggage threats 400% more accurately and 91 times faster than a TSA officer, enhancing public safety and potentially saving lives.

### Research Problem

The ever-increasing rate of air travel has put a strain on security organizations like the US Transportation Security Agency (TSA). Within TSA‚Äôs airport-related responsibilities, X-ray threat detection is one of the most important, as it is the primary means of analyzing passengers‚Äô luggage for hazardous items. Figure 1 shows an example X-ray scan and the location of two dangerous items in the scan.

However, reports by *Forbes*, *ABC News*, *Newsweek*, and *The New York Times* indicate that TSA fails to catch 70-95% of dangerous items in multiple undercover government tests (Goldstein, 2017; Kerley & Cook, 2017; Meza, 2017; Smith, 2017). Ultimately, the failure of baggage screening tests is a result of human error. The logical solution is to minimize this human error by employing machine-run automatic threat detection (‚ÄúATD‚Äù) to analyze baggage scans.

### X-Net

X-Net is inspired by the YOLOv3 detection framework, which consists of a convolutional backbone network and a head detection network. Because the task of X-ray analysis is particularly difficult, several innovations were introduced into X-Net that improved its efficacy compared to the base YOLO model.

Specifically, *deep lateral stacks* were introduced in this research. These secondary branches stem off the main backbone network and allow for more stable gradients and shortcuts for information flow across different layers. Intuitively, they help X-Net perform a multi-staged and thus powerful analysis of an input baggage scan.

X-Net was trained on SIXray with around 11,000 training examples of dangerous or illegal items (including guns, knives, wrenches).

### Results

X-Net outperforms all other detection models, including state-of-the-art convolutional algorithms as well as the baseline TSA officer. Figure 2 showcases X-Net's classification accuracy compared to other models, and Figure 3 showcases X-Net's localization accuracy compared to other models.

Notably, X-Net is 400% more accurate than TSA in classification accuracy and nearly 91x faster. This speed increase is evident despite X-Net's deployment on an [edge Jetson Nano device](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit). The fact that X-Net can run efficiently on such a small device (which is highly portable and requires minimal wattage to run) is a testament to X-Net's potential impact in the public safety sector.
