title: V-BINDâ€“Deep Geometric Transformers for SARS-CoV-2 Treatment Design
---

This research presents a novel machine-learning approach, called V-BIND, for the identification of potential *de-novo* treatments against SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen of COVID-19. With V-BIND, 30 potential protein drugs were designedâ€“of which 27 bind effectively to the virus. V-BIND is patent-pending, and has been awarded the AEOP JSHS Momentum grant to continue research.

### Research Problem

Despite the existence of effective vaccines, there is no widely accepted COVID-19 drug therapy. The proposed algorithm designs drug therapies in the form of artificial miniproteins that bind to the viral spike protein, thereby disabling SARS-CoV-2â€™s attack method and preventing infection.

### V-BIND: An AI-Based Solution

Inspired by recent research into unsupervised pretraining of natural language models, V-BIND employs a dual-BERT Transformer architecture (denoted *Geometric Transformer*) as its core. The Geometric Transformer is pretrained on large protein sequence databases like UniProt and BFD, and then trained in a supervised manner on PDB-BIND to predict binding affinity between proteins.

Using the trained Geometric Transformer, gradient descent then operates directly on the amino-acid-level to design a protein that maximizes binding affinity to the target viral spike. In doing so, gradient descent leverages Geometric Transformer as a scoring guide to evaluate and improve a miniprotein drug. V-BIND is the first algorithm to apply this neural-network-guided paradigm to miniprotein drug design.

### Results

Out of 30 miniprotein inhibitors designed by V-BIND targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit RBD, 27 bound potently to the virus per the threshold given by Carslon et al. (2008). In Figure 2, one potential miniprotein drug is shown in a bound conformation to the viral spike target.

This high success rate (90%) indicates that V-BIND is a promising deep-learning tool in designing *de-novo* antiviral drugs. Moreover, V-BIND does not rely on prior biological or physiochemical knowledge, meaning that it instead implicitly learns to represent protein dynamics within its self-attention mechanisms. As a result, V-BIND can be applied to other protein design tasks as well: it can theoretically design miniprotein inhibitors of any virus whose initial membrane fusion is mediated via protein-protein interaction.

Outside of virology, V-BIND is applicable to diverse fields like neurodegeneration: its principles can aid in the design of drugs that inhibit AÎ² toxic aggregates linked in the onset of Alzheimer's Disease. Future research with V-BIND will explore these other fields more thoroughly.
